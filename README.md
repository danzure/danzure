#### 🙋‍♂️ About me:
Hello! I'm Dan, welcome to my personal GitHub. I've been in the IT Industry for nearly a decade, half of that has been spent working in and around Azure and the wider Microsft Cloud stack. I specialise in Microsoft Azure, and I currently hold my Microsoft Azure Solution Architect Certificattion. Here you will find repo's for all of my personal projects and various learning materials.

#### ⚒️ Personal Projects: 

Currently working on two repositories that utilise <b>Terraform</b>. The primary project can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/danzure/azurerm-templates">azurerm-templates</a>, utilising the azurerm provider to create some templates of various solutions and services within Azure. The secondary terraform project is the azuread-templates that you can find here: <a href="https://github.com/danzure/azuread-templates">azuread-templates</a> that utilises the azuread provider to create some base level IAM policies & configurations for within Microsoft Entra

<b>Please note</b>: These are personal projects that I work on during my free time so I have no estimated/ planned date of completion. README's will be fully updated for completed solutions/ configurations.
